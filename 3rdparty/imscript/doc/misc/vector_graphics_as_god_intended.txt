Simple vector graphics as God intended
======================================

By simple vector graphics I mean simple stuff in the plane: a few polygons and
circles with the occasional letter here and there.  Typically, if you want
vector things today, you use a SVG library, that can read svg files and
display them in opengl canvases, and everything.  This sucks, because the svg
file format is complicated to edit manually, and the object structure is
complicated also.

I rather prefer to use a trivial and very limited file format, where every
line contains the complete description of an object, this is trival to parse,
and the resulting graphics are trivial to edit (e.g., by doing arithmetic with
awk.)

# example file containing a point, a segment, a triangle and a text label
dot 33.34 282.9
segment 12.1 35.5 180.2 18.75
polygon 10 20 30 40 50 60
label 13 25 hello world


An important idea of this format is that objects have no color, lines have no
width, and text has no font nor size.  Thus, this format gives a higher-level
abstraction of the vector graphics as svg, and does not describe an exact
visualization.  In the intended usage, different vector graphics will be stored
on different files, and the user will be able to flip between them, or show
them in different colors.

A further, and essential, limitation is that the maximum number of objects in a
file is 1000.  If a user pays enough, we can grundingly increase this number up
to 1200, but no more.  This is an important design decision intended to
encourage brute-force algorithms over these data structures.
