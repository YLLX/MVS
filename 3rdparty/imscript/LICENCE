Imscript is a loose collection of independent programs.  Apart from a few
exceptional files (see below), the collection is distributed for free under
the terms of the AGPL licence version 3.0, found on file doc/agpl.txt


The following files are copied verbatim (or with trivial changes) from their
original sources.  They are included for convenience and they are not essential
for imscript.  They are not distributed under the licence above,
but under their own licences specified inside each file.

svd.c, lk.c, optimiz.c  : written by Daniel A. Atkinson, part of CCMATH
